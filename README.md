### Backend
#### I have used **JWT (Json Web Token)** for login and Signup functionality to authenticate securely and deployed that **Rest API** on Render

#### You can find the Link to Rest API Repo [HERE](https://github.com/NischayGoyal1/Suhora-Api)

#### Note 
**I have used free version of Render to Deploy API so it will take some time for the first request as it set the API to sleep**
